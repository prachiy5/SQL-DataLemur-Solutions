### Problem Description:
Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and the number of days between each user's first and last post.

#### `posts` Table:
| Column Name     | Type       |
|-----------------|------------|
| `user_id`       | integer    |
| `post_id`       | integer    |
| `post_content`  | text       |
| `post_date`     | timestamp  |

#### Example Input:
| `user_id` | `post_id` | `post_content`                                              | `post_date`           |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 151652    | 599415    | Need a hug                                                  | 07/10/2021 12:00:00  |
| 661093    | 624356    | Bed. Class 8-12. Work 12-3. Gym 3-5 or 6. Then class 6-10. | 07/29/2021 13:00:00  |
| 004239    | 784254    | Happy 4th of July!                                          | 07/04/2021 11:00:00  |
| 661093    | 442560    | Just going to cry myself to sleep after watching Marley...  | 07/08/2021 14:00:00  |
| 151652    | 111766    | I'm so done with covid - need travelling ASAP!              | 07/12/2021 19:00:00  |

#### Example Output:
| `user_id` | `days_between` |
|-----------|----------------|
| 151652    | 2              |
| 661093    | 21             |

**Explanation:**
- `user_id` 151652 has posts on **07/10/2021** and **07/12/2021**, so the difference between the first and last post is 2 days.
- `user_id` 661093 has posts on **07/08/2021** and **07/29/2021**, so the difference between the first and last post is 21 days.
- Only users with at least two posts in 2021 are included in the output.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input and output; this is just an example.

### Thought Process:
1. **Filter Posts for 2021:** Use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows where the `post_date` is in the year 2021.
2. **Find First and Last Posts:** Use `MIN(post_date)` and `MAX(post_date)` for each `user_id` to find the first and last post dates.
3. **Calculate the Difference:** Subtract the earliest post date from the latest post date to calculate the number of days.
4. **Filter Users with At Least Two Posts:** Use the `HAVING` clause to include only users who have posted at least twice.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT user_id,
       MAX(post_date::DATE) - MIN(post_date::DATE) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE DATE_PART('year', post_date) = 2021
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
